To reduce the load on hospitals, the government of India intends to make COVID-19 tests easily
available to the public, by opening temporary clinics for testing. For this project, we will be restricting
ourselves to the worst affected region of Maharashtra: Mumbai. Our goal will be to identify the
perfect locations for these test clinics, to ensure the ease of accessibility for the citizens of Mumbai.
These clinics will be set up in locations which are devoid of Hospitals nearby.
